# UROP - ARMI

The heart is fascinating in that it starts to beat while it is still forming. However, this also makes studying how the heart forms difficult - the heart moves rapidly during heartbeat and capturing the behaviour of heart cells requires the development of novel image analysis methods. This project will involve programming in Matlab to help build new software to analyse fluorescent images of the beating heart.

This GitHub repository documents the code worked on by Raymond Zhang during his UROP placement. It is based on Hajime Fukui's MATLAB code for phase matching the cardiac cycle, and makes further improvements on it. There are two main applications developed here - 

1. Phase Matching
2. Signal vs Time
