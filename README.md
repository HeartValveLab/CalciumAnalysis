# UROP

This GitHub repository documents the code worked on by Raymond Zhang during his UROP placement at the Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute.
The project involved programming in Matlab to help build new software to analyse fluorescent images of the beating heart.
It is based on Renee Chow and Hajime Fukui's MATLAB code for phase matching the cardiac cycle, and makes further improvements on it.
There are two main applications developed here - 

1. Phase Matching
2. Signal vs Time
